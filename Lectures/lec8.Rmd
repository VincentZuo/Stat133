#Today's plan:

1. Review Chapter 7: Wrangling and Data Verbs  
2. Chapter 8: Graphics and Their Grammars

#Chapter 7: Wrangling and Data Verbs

Last class we learned about the data verbs, arrange(), filter(), select(), mutate(), group_by, and summarise().

A few notes:

1. The function sum() takes a vector and adds up the elements.
```{r}
a <- c(1,2,2,2,3)
sum(a)  # sum of elements of a
sum(a==2) # number of elements of a that have the value 2
```

2. Sum is usefull in summarise(). For example suppose you want to display the number of times the name "Adam" and "John" appears in the BabyNames data table.
```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  summarise(Adam_sum= sum(name=="Adam"), John_sum= sum(name == "John"))
```

3. n() adds up the number of cases. It is usefull inside of summarise(). Lets find the number of boys names in the year 1890

```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  filter(year==1890, sex=="M") %>%
  summarise( total = n())
```

4. Tally() is another way to add up the number of cases of a data table. 
```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  filter(year==1890, sex=="M") %>%
  tally()   # tally calls the number of cases n
```
It is similar to nrow

```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  filter(year==1890, sex=="M") %>%
  nrow()  
````


###More complex examples of putting together data verbs:

Recall the data table Minneapolis2013 which lists the results of ballots from different wards in different precincts:
```{r}
head(Minneapolis2013)
```


Suppose want to order the Precincts according to which has the most number of ballots cast
```{r}
Minneapolis2013 %>%
  group_by(Precinct) %>%
  summarise(count=n()) %>%     # n() finds how many cases there are
  arrange(desc(count))
```
or

```{r}
Minneapolis2013 %>%
  group_by(Precinct) %>%
  tally(sort=TRUE)  
```

What if want to order Precincts with the most number of ballots cast having "BETSY HODGES" as First?

```{r}
Minneapolis2013 %>%
    filter(First =="BETSY HODGES") %>% 
    group_by(Precinct) %>%
    tally(sort=TRUE)
```



### Your turn:

1. How many votes are marked "BETSY HODGES" in the First and Second choice selection?

```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
Minneapolis2013 %>%
  filter(Second == "BETSY HODGES", First == "BETSY HODGES") %>%
  tally()   #could also use nrow here
```
or
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
Minneapolis2013 %>%
  group_by(First,Second) %>%
  tally() %>%
  filter(First=="BETSY HODGES", Second=="BETSY HODGES")
```



2. Here is BabyNames:
```{r}
head(BabyNames)
```

What is the 3 most popular names in BabyNames?

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
BabyNames %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(tot=sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(tot)) %>%
  head(3)
```


#Chapter 8: Graphics and their Grammar

ggplot2 is a grpahics package that uses the components of graphs (i.e. glyphs, aestetics, frames, scales, layers) --called the grammar of graphics. 

We call glyphs geoms now.

### examples
Here is the data table mosaicData::CPS85:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
frame <- CPS85 %>% ggplot(aes(x=age,y=wage)) 
frame + geom_point()
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
frame <- CPS85 %>% ggplot(aes(x=age,y=wage)) 
frame + geom_point(aes(shape=sex))
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
frame <- CPS85 %>% ggplot(aes(x=age,y=wage)) 
frame + geom_point(aes(shape=sex)) + facet_grid(married ~ .)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
frame <- CPS85 %>% ggplot(aes(x=age,y=wage)) 
frame + geom_point(aes(shape=married)) + ylim(0,30)
```


```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(tot=sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(tot)) %>%
  head(3)
```


Here is a cheet sheet:

### Your turn
Please make

```{r, echo=FALSE}
CPS85 %>% ggplot(aes(x=age,wage)) + geom_point(aes(color=married)) + facet_wrap(~sex)
```
