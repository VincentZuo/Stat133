## Regular expressions (chapter 16)

A __regular expression__ (regex) is a pattern that describes a set of strings.

example: The regex "[a-cx-z]"" matches "a","b","c","x","y","z"

example: The regex "ba+d"" matches "bad", "baad", "baaad" etc but not "bd"

Regular expressions are used for several purposes:

* to detect whether a pattern is contained in a string. Use `filter()` and `grepl()`

* to replace the elements of that pattern with something else. Use `mutate()` and `gsub()`

* to extract a component that matches the patterns. Use `extractMatches()` from the DataComputing package.

To illustrate, consider the baby names data, summarised to give the total count of each name for each sex.

```{r}
NameList <- BabyNames %>% 
  mutate( name=tolower(name) ) %>%
  group_by( name, sex ) %>%
  summarise( total=sum(count) ) %>%
  arrange( desc(total)) 
```

Here are some examples of patterns in names and the use of a regular expression to detect them.  The regular expression is the string in quotes.  `grepl()` is a function that compares a regular expression to a string, returning TRUE if there's a match, FALSE otherwise.

* The name contains "shine", as in "sunshine" or "moonshine"
    ```{r}
NameList %>% 
  filter( grepl( "shine", name ) ) %>% 
  head()
```

* The name contains three or more vowels in a row.

```{r}
NameList %>% 
  filter( grepl( "[aeiou]{3,}", name ) ) %>% 
  head()
```

* The name contains three or more consonants in a row.

```{r}
NameList %>% 
  filter( grepl( "[^aeiou]{3,}", name ) ) %>% 
  head()
```

* The name contains "mn"

```{r}
NameList %>% 
  filter( grepl( "mn", name ) ) %>% 
  head()
```

* The first, third, and fifth letters are consonants.

```{r}
NameList %>% 
  filter( grepl( "^[^aeiou].[^aeiou].[^aeiou]", name ) ) %>% 
  head()
```


### Examples of accomplishing tasks with regular expressions.


```{r,echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
Debt <- data.frame(country=c("World","United States", "Japan"),debt=c("$56,308 billion", "$17,607 billion","$9,872 billion"), percentGDP=c("64%","73.60%","214.30%"))

```


#### Get rid of percent signs and commas in numerals

Numbers often come with comma separators or unit symbols such as % or $.  For instance, here is part of a table about public debt from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt).

```{r}
head(Debt,3)
```

To use these numbers for computations, they must be cleaned up.

```{r}
Debt %>% 
  mutate( debt=gsub("[$,%]|billion","",debt),
          percentGDP=gsub("[,%]", "", percentGDP)) %>%
  head(3)
```

#### Remove a currency sign 

```{r}
gsub("^\\$|€|¥|£|¢$","", c("$100.95", "45¢"))
```

#### Remove leading or trailing spaces

```{r}
gsub( "^ +| +$", "", "   My name is Julia     ")
```

#### How often do boys' names end in vowels?

```{r}
NameList %>%
  filter( grepl( "[aeiou]$", name ) ) %>% 
  group_by( sex ) %>% 
  summarise( total=sum(total) )
```

Girls' names are almost five times as likely to end in vowels as boys' names.

#### What are the most common end vowels for names?

To answer this question, you have to extract the last vowel from the name.  The `extractMatches()` transformation function can do this.  

```{r}
NameList %>% 
  extractMatches(data=., "([aeiou])$", name, vowel=1 ) %>%
  group_by( sex, vowel ) %>% 
  summarise( total=sum(total) ) %>%
  arrange( sex, desc(total) )
```


### Reading Regular Expressions

There are simple regular expressions and complicated ones.  All of them look foreign until you learn how to read them.

There are many regular expression tutorials on the Internet, for instance [this interactive one](http://regexone.com/). Here is a useful [cheat sheet](http://krijnhoetmer.nl/stuff/regex/cheat-sheet/)

Some basics:

* Very simple patterns:
    * A single `.` means "any character."
    
    * A character, e.g., `b`, means just that character.
    
    * Characters enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `[aeiou]` means any of those characters.  (So, `[aeiou]` is a pattern describing a vowel.) 
    
    * The `^` inside square brackets means "any except these."  So, a consonant is `[^aeiou]`
    
* Alternatives.  A vertical bar means "either."  For example `(A|a)dam` matches `Adam` and `adam`

* Repeats

     * Two simple patterns in a row, means those patterns consecutively.  Example: `M[aeiou]` means a capital M followed by a lower-case vowel.
     
     * A simple pattern followed by a `+` means "one or more times." For example `M(ab)+` means `M` followed by one or more `ab`.  
     
     * A simple pattern followed by a `?` means "zero or one time."
     
     * A simple pattern followed by a `*` means "zero or more times."
     
     * A simple pattern followed by `{2}` means "exactly two times."  Similarly, `{2,5}` means between two and five times, `{6,}` means six times or more.
     
* Start and end of strings.  For instance, `[aeiou]{2}` means "exactly two vowels in a row."

    * `^` at the beginning of a regular expression means "the start of the string"
    
    * `$` at the end means "the end of the string."



## Task for you

Indicate which strings contain a match
![](/Users/Adam/Desktop/stat133lectures_hw_lab/regex.png)


Note: you can experiment with `grepl(pattern,x)` for example:
```{r}
x <- c("hi mabc","abc","abcd","abccd","abcabcdx","cab","abd","cad")
grepl("a[b?d]",x)
```


The metacharacters in Regular Expressions are:

`.` `\` `|` `(` `)` `[` `]` `{` `$` `*` `+` `?`

![](/Users/Adam/Desktop/stat133lectures_hw_lab/regex1.png)


Example:
```{r}
grepl("[a\\.]", c("hello.bye", "adam"))
```

There are also built-in character sets for commonly used collections.

![](/Users/Adam/Desktop/stat133lectures_hw_lab/regex2.png)

Example:

```{r}
x <- c ("a0b", "a1b","a12b")
grepl("a[[:digit:]]b",x)
```


```{r}
x <- c (3,"a","b","?")
grepl("[[:digit:]abc]",x)
```



## Task for you
Write a regular expression that matches

1. only the strings "cat","at","t"

```{r,include=show_answers}
x <- c("cat","at","t","ta","acata")
grepl("^c?a?t$",x)
```


2. the strings "cat", "caat", "caaat", and so on.

```{r,include=show_answers}
x <- c("cat","caat","caaat")
grepl("^ca+t$",x)
```


3. "dog", “Dog”,“dOg”,“doG”,“DOg”, etc. (i.e., the word dog in any combination of upper and lower case)
```{r,include=show_answers}
x <- c("dog", "Dog" , "dOg", "doG" , "DOg")
grepl("(d|D)(o|O)(g|G)",x)
```

4. any positive number, with or without a decimal point

```{r,include=show_answers}
x <- c(1, 12.4,-56.899,  0, -23)
grepl("^-?[0-9]+.?[0-9]*$",x)
```


5. any line with exactly two words separated by any amount of whitespace (spaces or tabs). There may or may not be whitespace at the beginning or end of the line.
```{r,include=show_answers}
x <- c("   stat rocks", "I love stats")
grepl("^[[:blank:]]*[[:alpha:]]+[[:blank:]]+[[:alpha:]]+[[:blank:]]*$",x)

```
