#Today
1. Finish regular expressions (chapter 16)
2. Time for questions about midterm review

# Regular expressions 

Here again is a useful [cheat sheet](http://krijnhoetmer.nl/stuff/regex/cheat-sheet/)

## Tasks for you

Write a regular expression that matches

1. Any positive or negative number (ex -56.899)

```{r }
x <- c(1, +12.4,-56.899,  0, -23, .000, -0, "4.5.3")
grepl("^[-+]?[0-9]+\\.?[0-9]*$",x)
#or
grepl("^[-+]?[[:digit:]]+\\.?[[:digit:]]*$",x)
```


2. any line with exactly two words separated by any amount of whitespace (spaces or tabs). There may or may not be whitespace at the beginning or end of the line.
```{r}
x <- c("   stats rocks", "I love stats")
grepl("^[[:blank:]]*[[:alpha:]]+[[:blank:]]+[[:alpha:]]+[[:blank:]]*$",x)

```

## `grepl()`, `gsub()`, `extractMatches()`

Regular expressions are used for several purposes:

* to detect whether a pattern is contained in a string. Use `filter()` and `grepl()`

details:

1. grepl() searches for matches to regexp within each element of a character vector and returns a logical vector

2. syntax: `grepl(regex,vec)`

example: Here is a list of names from the Bible:
```{r}
BibleNames <- read.file("http://tiny.cc/dcf/BibleNames.csv")
head(BibleNames)
```

Which names have any words in them: "bar", "dam", "lory"?

```{r}
BibleNames %>%
  filter(grepl("(bar)|(dam)|(lory)", name)) %>%
  head()
```


* to replace the elements of that pattern with something else. Use `mutate()` and `gsub()`

details:

1. `gsub()` searches for matches to argument regexp within each element of a character vector and performs replacement of all matches
 
2. syntax:`gsub(regex, replacement, vec)`

```{r,echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
Debt <- data.frame(country=c("World","United States", "Japan"),debt=c("$56,308 billion", "$17,607 billion","$9,872 billion"), percentGDP=c("64%","73.60%","214.30%"))

```

Clean up the Debt data table below so it only has numbers

```{r}
head(Debt)
```

```{r}
Debt %>% 
  mutate( debt=gsub("[$,]|billion","",debt),
          percentGDP=gsub("%", "", percentGDP))
```


* to pull out the matches for marked regions of regular expressions use `extractMatches()` from the DataComputing package.

Details:

1. input is a data table and output is a data table with one or more additional columns with the extractions

2. syntax is `df %>% extractMatches(regex, var,...)` 

3. wrap part of the regexp in parentheses to signal that the matching content is to be extracted as a string

4. when there is no match `extractMatches()` returns `NA`
example

```{r}
data.frame(string=c("hi there there","bye")) %>% extractMatches("r(e)",string)

```


What are the most common end vowels for Bible names?

To answer this question, you have to extract the last vowel from the name.  The `extractMatches()` transformation function can do this.  

```{r}
BibleNames %>% 
  extractMatches( "([aeiou])$", name, vowel = 1) %>% 
  group_by(vowel ) %>% 
  summarise( total= n()) %>%
  arrange( vowel, desc(total) )
```

What Bible Names start and end with a vowel?

```{r}
BibleNames %>% 
  extractMatches( "^([AEIOU]).*([aeiou])$", name, beg_vowel=1, end_vowel=2) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(beg_vowel) & !is.na(end_vowel)) %>%
  select(-meaning) %>%
  head()
```


#Tasks for you

1. Which Bible names in `BibleNames` have the word "man" in the meaning?

```{r}
BibleNames %>% 
  filter(grepl("[[:blank:]]+man[[:blank:]]+",meaning))
```

2. Grab everything but the last letter of `names` in `BibleNames` that end with a vowel (example: Grab Ev from Eva)

```{r}
BibleNames %>% 
  extractMatches(pattern="(.*)[aeiouy]$", name, root=1) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(match)) %>%
  select(-meaning) %>%
  head()
```

##Iclicker

```{r, echo=show_answers, eval=show_answers}
BibleNames %>% extractMatches("^[A-Z]..(.*)[aeiou]$", name, match=1) %>% head(4)
```
