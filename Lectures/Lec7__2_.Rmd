#Today:

1. Review ideas of Chapter 6 (Frames, Glyphs, and other components of graphs)
2. Chapter 7 (Wrangling and Data Verbs)

#Chapter 6 

Volcabulary:

See figure 6.7 page 57  

*Frame*= The space for drawing gyphs. Here a rectangular region set by roadways and gdp.  
*Glyph*= A symbol or a marking in a frame . There is one glyph for for each case in the data table. Here points.  
*Aesthetics*= The properties of a glyph. Here x,y, size.  
_Scales and Guides_= Variables of the data table are *mapped* to aesthetics of the glyph. Here, x=roadways, y= gdp, educ= size  
*Facets*= Multiple side by side graphs used to display levels of a categorical variable. Here facets are different ranges of Internet connectivity.    
*Layers*= data from more than one data table are graphed together. Here not layered.  

#In class exercise:
Look at graph from [nytimes](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/comparisons.html) on prediction of 36 senate seats from different polling organizations. 

1. What variables define the frame in this graphic?
2. What is the glyph and its graphical attributes (i.e. aesthetics)?
3. What do you think the scales are?

#Chapter 7 Wrangling and Data Verbs

Rarely is a data table *glyph ready*. We usually need to *wrangle* the data.
For example say we want to make a bar chart ranking the candidates by how many precincts they are in first place.

```{r}
#not glyph ready
head(Minneapolis2013)



FirstPlaceTally <- Minneapolis2013 %>% 
  rename(candidate=First) %>%
  group_by(candidate) %>%
  summarise(total=n()) %>%
  arrange( desc(total))

#glyph ready

FirstPlaceTally

```




Here is a nice presentation of Data Verbs we will be using:
[link](http://dtkaplan.github.io/DCF-2014/CourseNotes/BasicDataCommands/MoreDataVerbs.html)

#In class exercise:

Each of these tasks can be performed using a single data  
verb. For each task, say which verb it is:
choices are: summarise(), mutate(), arrange(), filter(), select(), group_by()
```{r}
```{r}

```

```

a. Find the average of one of the variables.

b. Add a new column that is the ratio between two variables.

c. Sort the cases in descending order of a variable. 

d. Create a new data table that includes only those cases that meet a criterion.

e. From a data table with several variables produce an output that has the same cases but only the first two variables.

f. From a data table with a categorical variables and a quantitative variable produce a count for the number of cases for each level of the categorical variable. 


solution:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
mtcars <- mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, cyl, disp) 
```

```{r}
mtcars
```


a.
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  summarise(avg_count=mean(cyl))
```
b.
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  mutate(ratio=mpg/cyl) %>% 
  tail()
 
```
c.
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  arrange(desc(mpg)) %>%
  tail()
```
d.
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  filter(mpg >30)
```
e.

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg, cyl) %>%
  tail()
```
f.



```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(total=sum(count))
```

#iclicker question from class
The graph presented in class isn't *glyph* ready. You need to do some data wrangling. Notice that we need to join two tables to get a table including LandArea. This is a correction from class. We will do joins in chapter 10.
```{r}
table1 <- ZipGeography %>% 
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(aveZipPopulation=mean(Population, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(aveZipPopulation)
  
table2 <- ZipGeography %>%
  select(State, LandArea)
  
table1 %>% left_join(table2,by="State")
```
