#Midterm

The **Midterm** will cover data wrangling and ggplot (I expect chapters 1-14 excluding chapter 13 and the relavent covered material on data camp) and the first 4 chapters of Intermediate R in Data Camp. It will consist of a 50 min written test. You will be able to use a cheat sheet for syntax. I will provide you with sample problems  and a detailed description of the topics soon.

# 1. Conditionals and Control Flow



Computing in R consists of sequentially evaluating statements. _Flow control_ structures allow us to control which statements are evaluated and in what order.
In R the primary ones consist of

* if/else statements and the ifelse function  
* for and while loops

Expressions, such as `p <- .5` and `sample(c(1, 0), size = 1, prob = c(p, 1-p))` can be grouped together using curly braces “{” and “}”. A group of expressions is called a block. For today’s lecture, the word _statement_ will refer to either a single expression or a block.

The basic syntax for an `if/else` statement is

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if ( condition ) {
  statement1
} else {
  statement2
}
```

You can also write this on a single line as:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
if(condition) statement1 else statement2
```


First, `condition` is evaluated. If the first element of the result is `TRUE` then statement1 is evaluated. If the first element of the result is `FALSE` then statement2 is evaluated. Only the first element of the result is used. If the result is numeric, 0 is treated as FALSE and any other number as TRUE. If the result is not logical or numeric, or if it is NA, you will get an error.

For example, 
```{r}
a <- c(3==2,5==5,0)
a
if(a){
  print("hi")
} else{
  print("bye")
}
```

However, 
```{r,eval=FALSE}
if("pizza"){
  print("hi")
} else{
  print("bye")
}
```
this will result in an error `Error in if ("pizza") { : argument is not interpretable as logical`

When we discussed Boolean algebra before, we met the operators & (AND) and | (OR).

Recall that these are both vectorized operators. For example:

```{r}
x <- c(.2,3.3,.4)
(x < -1 | x > 1)
```

If/else statements, on the other hand, are based on a single,“global” condition. So we often see constructions using `any` or `all` to express something related to the whole vector, like
```{r}

if(any(x<-1|x>1)) print("hi") else print("bye")

if(all(x < -1|x > 1)) print("hi") else print("bye")
```

The result of an if/else statement can be assigned. For example, these give the same result:

```{r}
x <- c(.2,3.3,.4)

y <- if ( any(x <= 0) ) log(1+x) else log(x)
y

if ( any(x <= 0) ) y <- log(1+x) else y <- log(x)
y

```

Also,the else clause is optional. Another way to do the above is:

```{r}
if( any(x <= 0) ) x <- 1+x
y <- log(x)
y
```
However this changes x as well.


If/else statements can be nested.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
if (condition1 )
  statement1
else if (condition2)
  statement2
else if (condition3)
  statement3
else
  statement4

```


The conditions are evaluated, in order, until one evaluates to `TRUE`. The the associated statement/block is evaluated. The statement in the final else clause is evaluated if none of the conditions evaluates to `TRUE`.



A note about formatting if/else statements:


When the if statement is not in a block, the `else` (if present) must appear on the same line as `statement1` or immediately following the closing brace. For example,


```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (condition) {statement1}
else {statement2}
```

will be an error. For example 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if(3==2){ print("hi")}
else {print("bye")}
```

gives an error `Error: unexpected 'else' in "else"`

I suggest using the format

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (condition) {
  statement1
} else {
  statement2
}
```

## Some common uses of if/else clauses

1. With logical arguments to tell a function what to do

```{r}
corplot <-  function(x,y,plotit=TRUE){
  df=data.frame(var1=x,var2=y)
  p <-  df %>% ggplot(aes(x=var1,y=var2)) + geom_point(size=3) +theme(text=element_text(size=25))
  if(plotit) print(p)
  cor(x,y)
}

corplot(runif(n=100,min=0,max=1),runif(n=100,min=0,max=1))
```

2. To verify that the arguments of a function are as expected

```{r}
m=matrix(c(1,2,3,4),nrow=2)
if( !is.matrix(m)){
  stop("m must be a matrix")
} else{
  print("hi")
}


```
but 
```{r,eval=FALSE}
m=c(1,2,3)
if( !is.matrix(m)){
  stop("m must be a matrix")
  print("hi")
}
```
will throw an error `Error: m must be a matrix`


3. To handle common numerical errors

```{r}
y <- 3
x <- 0
ratio <- if(x!=0) y/x else NA
ratio
```

4. In general, to control which block of code is executed

```{r}
normt <- function(n, dist){
  if ( dist == "normal" ){
    return( rnorm(n) )
  } else if (dist == "t"){
    return(rt(n, df = 1, ncp = 0))
  } else stop("distribution not implemented")
}
normt(10,"t")
```

These if/else constructions are useful for global tests, not tests applied to individual elements of a vector.

However, there is a vectorized function called `ifelse`


```{r}
args(ifelse)
```

Here `test` is an R object that can be coerced to logical. `yes` and `no` are R objects of the same size as test

```{r}
y=2
x=c(-1,0,2)
x!=0
y/x
NA
ifelse(x!=0, y/x,NA)
```

For each element of `test`, the corresponding element of `yes` is returned if the element is `TRUE`, and the corresponding element of `no` is returned if it is `FALSE`.

# Task for you

The modulo operator in R is %%. For example
```{r}
15 %% 2
15 %% 3
```

Assign true to the boolean variable leapYear if the integer variable year is a
leap year. The rule for determining leap years is that one of the following conditions must hold:
1) the year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or 
2) the year is divisible by 400.


```{r,include=FALSE}
year <- 2013
if((year%%4==0 & year%%100 != 0) | (year%% 400 ==0)  ) {leapyear <- TRUE
}else{
  leapyear <- FALSE
}
leapyear
```

```{r,include=TRUE}
year <-  2016
if((year%%4==0 & year%%100 != 0) | (year%% 400 ==0)  ) leapyear <- TRUE  else leapyear <- FALSE
leapyear
```

Can you do this if year is a vector 2000:2016?
```{r,include=TRUE}
year <- 2000:2016
leapyear <- ifelse((year%%4 & year%%100 !=0) | (year%% 400 ==0), TRUE,FALSE)
leapyear
```

# 2. Loops

Looping is the repeated evaluation of a statement or block of statements.

Much of what is handled using loops in other languages can be more efficiently handled in R using vectorized calculations or one of the `apply` mechanisms.

However, certain algorithms, such as those requiring recursion, can only be handled by loops.

There are two main looping constructs in R: `for` and `while`.

## for loops

A for loop repeats a statement or block of statements a predefined number of times.

The syntax in R is
```{r, eval=FALSE}

for ( name in vector ){
  statement
}

```

For each element in `vector`, the variable `name` is set to the
value of that element and `statement` is evaluated.

vector often contains integers, but can be any valid type.

Examples:
```{r}
for( word in c("my","name","is","adam")){
  print(word)
}
```


or 

```{r}
xseq <- seq(-2.5, 2.5, length = 100) 
yseq <- xseq^2
df <- data.frame(xseq,yseq) 
p <- df %>% ggplot(aes(x=xseq, y=yseq)) + geom_line(stat="identity", col="red")

for(i in -2:2){
 p <- p + geom_point(x=i,y=2,col="blue",size=3)
}
p

```

## while loops

A while loop repeats a statement or block of statements
for as many times as a particular condition is `TRUE`.

The syntax in R is

```{r,eval=FALSE}
while (condition){
  statement
}
```

`condition` is evaluated, and if it is `TRUE`, statement is evaluated. This process continues until condition evaluates to `FALSE`.

# Task for you

The expression,

```{r,eval=FALSE}
sample(c(1, 0), size = 1, prob = c(p, 1-p))
```

simulates a random coin flip, where the coin has probability p of coming up heads, represented by a 1.
For p=.5 simulate flipping a coin until 20 of heads are obtained. Produce the vector of 0 and 1.


```{r, include=TRUE}
p=.5
count=0
flips=c()
while(count<20){
  flip= sample(c(1, 0), size = 1, prob = c(p, 1-p))
  flips=c(flips,flip)
  count=count + flip
}
flips
```

The break statement causes a loop to exit. This is particularly useful with while loops, which, if we’re not careful, might loop indefinitely (or until we kill R).

Here is an example:
```{r}
# Simulate steps for random walk to cross threshold = 10
max.iter <- 10000
x <- 0
steps <- 0
mywalk=c()
while(x < 10){
  x <- x + sample(c(-1, 1), 1)
  steps <- steps + 1
  mywalk=c(mywalk,x)
  if(steps == max.iter){
    warning("Maximum iteration reached")
    break }
}
mywalk %>% head(100)
```
