#Chapter 10: Joining two Tables

```{r}
Grades <- read.file("http://tiny.cc/mosaic/grades.csv")
head(Grades,10)
```

```{r}
Courses <- read.file("http://tiny.cc/mosaic/courses.csv")
head(Courses,10)
```

###Joins
A *join* is a data verb that combines two tables.

* These care called the left and the right tables.
There are several kinds of join.

* All involve establishing a correspondance — a match — between each case in the left table and zero or more cases in the right table.
* The various joins differ in how they handle multiple matches or missing matches.

###Example: Average class size

####Goal: Figure out the average class size seen by each student.

* enroll comes from Courses table.
* Student (sid) comes from Grades.
* sessionID is in both tables.

```{r}
joined_tables <- Grades %>%
  select(sid, sessionID) %>%
  left_join(Courses %>% select(enroll, sessionID), by=c("sessionID"="sessionID"))
 head(joined_tables, 10) 
 
```

#### Task for you
Make the following plot of the average class size for each student.
```{r}

 
 avg_class_size <-  joined_tables %>%
   group_by(sid) %>%
   summarise(avg=mean(enroll, na.rm=TRUE))
#head(avg_class_size)
avg_class_size %>% ggplot(aes(x=sid, y=avg)) + geom_point() + scale_x_discrete(breaks=NULL)
```


Note: To figure out how to remove the tick mark labels (which aren't legible) a good resource is the [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Axes_(ggplot2)/)

## Most popular joins: 

* left_join() The output has all the cases from the Left, even if there is no match in the right. If there is no match in the right you get NA
* inner_join() the output has only the cases from the Left with a match in the Right

inner joins are usefull for filtering. For example suppose I want to know the departments where the most students get good grades.

```{r}
good_grades <- Grades %>% 
  filter(grade %in% c("A","A-"))
head(good_grades)
good_depts <- good_grades %>% 
  inner_join(Courses) %>% 
  group_by(dept) %>% 
  tally(sort=TRUE)
head(good_depts)
```


# Chap 8 (More ggplot2)

It is important to be able to look up the syntax and aesetics for the different geoms. Here is a good resourse from [ggplot2.org](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html)

#Example

The data table `Birth78` in MosaicData package gives a day by day record of the number of births in the United States in 1978.

```{r}
head(Births78)
```

### Task for you
Make a new table DailyBirths that gives the average of births on the different days of the week for each month of the year. You will need to use the function lubridate::month(date) which gives you the month from `date`.
For example:
```{r}
head(Births78$date)
head(month(Births78$date))
```
For purposes of clarity later, we will rename wday as Wday using `rename()`:
```{r}
myBirths78 <- Births78 %>% rename(Wday=wday)
head(myBirths78)
```

1. Make the following plot:

```{r}
avg_Births <- myBirths78 %>% 
  mutate(Month=month(date)) %>%
  group_by(Month,Wday) %>% 
  summarise(avg=mean(births))
head(avg_Births)
plot1 <- avg_Births %>% ggplot(aes(x=Wday,y=avg)) +geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(Month)))
plot1
```

2. You can find a data set listing US federal holidays at `http://tiny.cc/dcf/US-Holidays.csv`.  Read it in as follows:^[The point of the `lubridate::dmy()` function is to convert the character-string date stored in the CSV to a POSIX date-number.] 

```{r}
Holidays <- read.csv("http://tiny.cc/dcf/US-Holidays.csv") %>%
mutate(date = lubridate::dmy(date))
```
Filter out cases that are not in the month of November or December
```{r}
my_months=c(11,12)
myHolidays <- Holidays %>% filter(month(date) %in% my_months , year(date)==1978) 
```

3.  Add a layer to your plot from (1). Draw a vertical bar at each date which is a holiday in November or January.  You'll use the `geom_vline()` glyph.  You can give a `data = ` argument to `geom_vline()` to tell it to plot out the information from `Holidays` rather than `MyTwoYears`.  
  
 
```{r}
plot2 <- avg_Births %>% ggplot(aes(x=Wday, y=avg)) + geom_point(aes(color=Wday)) +geom_vline(data= myHolidays, aes(xintercept=wday(date), color=wday(date,label=TRUE))) 

plot2

```
 
  
  
  
4. Add a text label to each of the vertical bars to identify which holiday it is.  Use the `geom_text()` glyph.^[Hints: You'll have to make up a y-coordinate for each label.  You can set the orientation of each label with the `angle` aesthetic.]    
```{r}
plot3 <- plot2 + geom_text(data = myHolidays,
           aes(x = wday(date), y = 9000, label = holiday, angle = 65))
plot3
```






4. Next your layer your graph with a horizontal line with yintercept equal to the average number of births in for a day in 1978. Make the following plot:

```{r}
avg <- Births78 %>% summarise(avg=mean(births))
plot4 <- plot3 + geom_hline(yintercept = avg[1,1])
plot4
```


5. Use `annotate()` to label the horizontal line as average  

```{r}
plot4 + annotate("text", label="avg", x="Sun", y=9000)
```
