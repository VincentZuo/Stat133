## Regular expressions (chapter 16)

A __regular expression__ (regex) is a pattern that describes a set of strings.

example: The regex "[a-cx-z]"" matches "a","b","c","x","y","z"

example: The regex "ba+d"" matches "bad", "baad", "baaad" etc but not "bd"

### Examples of accomplishing tasks with regular expressions.

```{r}
NameList <- BabyNames %>% 
  mutate( name=tolower(name) ) %>%
  group_by( name, sex ) %>%
  summarise( total=sum(count) ) %>%
  arrange( desc(total)) 
```


* The name contains "shine", as in "sunshine" or "moonshine"
    ```{r}
NameList %>% 
  filter( grepl( "shine", name ) ) %>% 
  head()
```

* The name contains three or more vowels in a row.

```{r}
NameList %>% 
  filter( grepl( "[aeiou]{3,}", name ) ) %>% 
  head()
```

* The name contains three or more consonants in a row.

```{r}
NameList %>% 
  filter( grepl( "[^aeiou]{3,}", name ) ) %>% 
  head()
```

* The name contains "mn"

```{r}
NameList %>% 
  filter( grepl( "mn", name ) ) %>% 
  head()
```

* The first, third, and fifth letters are consonants.

```{r}
NameList %>% 
  filter( grepl( "^[^aeiou].[^aeiou].[^aeiou]", name ) ) %>% 
  head()
```

* How often do boys' and girls' names end in vowels?

```{r}
NameList %>%
  filter( grepl( "[aeiou]$", name ) ) %>% 
  group_by( sex ) %>% 
  summarise( total=sum(total) )
```

* What are the most common end vowels for names?

To answer this question, you have to extract the last vowel from the name.  The `extractMatches()` transformation function can do this.  

```{r}
NameList %>% 
  extractMatches( "([aeiou])$", name, vowel=1 ) %>%
  group_by( sex, vowel ) %>% 
  summarise( total=sum(total) ) %>%
  arrange( sex, desc(total) )
```


#### 2. Here are some examples of data cleaning a table downloaded from the web.



```{r,echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
Debt <- data.frame(country=c("World","United States", "Japan"),debt=c("$56,308 billion", "$17,607 billion","$9,872 billion"), percentGDP=c("64%","73.60%","214.30%"))

```


* Get rid of percent signs and commas in numerals

Numbers often come with comma separators or unit symbols such as % or $.  For instance, here is part of a table about public debt from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt).

```{r}
head(Debt,3)
```

To use these numbers for computations, they must be cleaned up.

```{r}
Debt %>% 
  mutate( debt=gsub("[$,%]|billion","",debt),
          percentGDP=gsub("[,%]", "", percentGDP)) %>%
  head(3)
```

* Remove a currency sign 

```{r}
gsub("^\\$|â,¬|¥|£|$","", c("$100.95", "45Â¢"))
```

* Remove leading or trailing spaces

```{r}
gsub( "^ +| +$", "", "   My name is Julia     ")
```


### Reading Regular Expressions

There are simple regular expressions and complicated ones.  All of them look foreign until you learn how to read them.


Some basics:

* Very simple patterns:
    * A single `.` means "any character."
    
    * A character, e.g., `b`, means just that character.
    
    * Characters enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `[aeiou]` means any of those characters.  (So, `[aeiou]` is a pattern describing a vowel.) 
    
    * The `^` inside square brackets means "any except these."  So, a consonant is `[^aeiou]`
    
* Alternatives.  A vertical bar means "either."  For example `(A|a)dam` matches `Adam` and `adam`

* Repeats

     * Two simple patterns in a row, means those patterns consecutively.  Example: `M[aeiou]` means a capital M followed by a lower-case vowel.
     
     * A simple pattern followed by a `+` means "one or more times." For example `M(ab)+` means `M` followed by one or more `ab`.  
     
     * A simple pattern followed by a `?` means "zero or one time."
     
     * A simple pattern followed by a `*` means "zero or more times."
     
     * A simple pattern followed by `{2}` means "exactly two times."  Similarly, `{2,5}` means between two and five times, `{6,}` means six times or more.
     
* Start and end of strings.  For instance, `[aeiou]{2}` means "exactly two vowels in a row."

    * `^` at the beginning of a regular expression means "the start of the string"
    
    * `$` at the end means "the end of the string."
    
Note: you can experiment with `grepl(pattern,x)` for example:
```{r}
x <- c("hi mabc","abc","abcd","abccd","abcabcdx","cab","abd","cad")
```

```{r}
x[grepl("abc",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("^abc",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("abc.d",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("abc+d",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("abc?d",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("abc$",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("abc.*d",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("abc*d",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("abc?",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("a[bd]",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("a[b|d]",x)]
```

```{r}
x[grepl("a[b?d]",x)]
```

Example:
```{r}
c("hello.bye", "adam")[grepl("[a\\.]", c("hello.bye", "adam"))]
```

```{r}
x <- c ("a0b", "a1b","a12b")
x[grepl("a[[:digit:]]b",x)]
```

```{r}
x <- c (3,"a","b","?")
x[grepl("[[:digit:]abc]",x)]
```

## Task for you
Write a regular expression that matches

1. only the strings "cat","at","t"

```{r}
x <- c("cat","at","t","ta","ct")
x[grepl("^(ca|a)?t$",x)]

```

```{r}
#Doesn't work
x <- c("cat","at","t","ta","ct")
x[grepl("^c?a?t$",x)]

```

2. the strings "cat", "caat", "caaat", and so on.

```{r}
x <- c("cat","caat","caaat")
x[grepl("^ca+t$",x)]
```


3. (i.e., the word dog in any combination of upper and lower case)
```{r}
x <- c("dog", "Dog" , "dOg", "doG" , "DOg")
grepl("(d|D)(o|O)(g|G)",x)
```


Write a regular expression that matches

1. Any number  (ex -56.899 or 0)

```{r}
x <- c(1, +12.4,-56.899,  0, -23, .000, -0, "4.5.3")
x[grepl("^[-+]?[0-9]+\\.?[0-9]*$",x)]
#or
x[grepl("^[-+]?[[:digit:]]+\\.?[[:digit:]]*$",x)]
```


2. any line with exactly two words separated by any amount of whitespace (spaces or tabs). There may or may not be whitespace at the beginning or end of the line.
```{r}
x <- c("   stats rocks", "I love stats")
x[grepl("^[[:blank:]]*[[:alpha:]]+[[:blank:]]+[[:alpha:]]+[[:blank:]]*$",x)]

```

* to replace the elements of that pattern with something else. Use `mutate()` and `gsub()`

details:

1. `gsub()` searches for matches to argument regexp within each element of a character vector and performs replacement of all matches
 
2. syntax:`gsub(regex, replacement, vec)`

```{r,echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
Debt <- data.frame(country=c("World","United States", "Japan"),debt=c("$56,308 billion", "$17,607 billion","$9,872 billion"), percentGDP=c("64%","73.60%","214.30%"))

```

Clean up the Debt data table below so it only has numbers

```{r}
head(Debt)
```

```{r}
Debt %>% 
  mutate( debt=gsub("[$,]|billion","",debt),
          percentGDP=gsub("%", "", percentGDP))
```


* to pull out the matches for marked regions of regular expressions use `extractMatches()` from the DataComputing package.

Details:

1. input is a data table and output is a data table with one or more additional columns with the extractions

2. syntax is `df %>% extractMatches(regex, var,...)` 

3. wrap part of the regexp in parentheses to signal that the matching content is to be extracted as a string

4. when there is no match `extractMatches()` returns `NA`
example

```{r}
data.frame(string=c("hi there there","bye")) %>% extractMatches("r(e)",string)

```


What are the most common end vowels for Bible names?

To answer this question, you have to extract the last vowel from the name.  The `extractMatches()` transformation function can do this.  

```{}
BibleNames %>% 
  extractMatches( "([aeiou])$", name, vowel=1) %>% 
  group_by(vowel ) %>% 
  summarise( total= n()) %>%
  arrange( vowel, desc(total) )
```

What Bible Names start and end with a vowel?

```{}
BibleNames %>% 
  extractMatches( "^([AEIOU]).*([aeiou])$", name, beg_vowel=1, end_vowel=2) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(beg_vowel) & !is.na(end_vowel)) %>%
  select(-meaning) %>%
  head()
```


#Tasks for you

1. Which Bible names in `BibleNames` have the word "man" in the meaning (not first or last word)?

```{}
BibleNames %>% 
  filter(grepl("[[:blank:]]+man[[:blank:]]+",meaning))
```

2. Grab everything but the last letter of `names` in `BibleNames` that end with a vowel (example: Grab Ev from Eva)

```{}
BibleNames %>% 
  extractMatches(pattern="(.*)[aeiouy]$", name, root=1) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(root)) %>%
  select(-meaning) %>%
  head()
```


```{}
Ctrl + A	Go to the beginning of the line you are currently typing on
Ctrl + E	Go to the end of the line you are currently typing on
Ctrl + L              	Clears the Screen, similar to the clear command
Ctrl + U	Clears the line before the cursor position. If you are at the end of the line, clears the entire line.
Ctrl + H	Same as backspace
Ctrl + R	Let's you search through previously used commands
Ctrl + C	Kill whatever you are running
Ctrl + D	Exit the current shell
Ctrl + Z	Puts whatever you are running into a suspended background process. fg restores it.
Ctrl + W	Delete the word before the cursor
Ctrl + K	Clear the line after the cursor
Ctrl + T	Swap the last two characters before the cursor
Esc + T	Swap the last two words before the cursor
Alt + F	Move cursor forward one word on the current line
Alt + B	Move cursor backward one word on the current line
Tab	Auto-complete files and folder names

EXAMPLES:   
`pwd`,  
`mkdir unixexamples`,  
`cd unixexamples`,  
`ls`,  
`ls -a`  
`ls -l`

`ls -a` means to show all files, including the hidden files starting with a dot

The two hidden files here are special and exist in every directory. refers to the current directory,refers to the directory above it.

`ls -l` shows the size of the files which can be useful.

This brings us to the distinction between relative and absolute path names. (Think of a path like an address in UNIX, telling you where you are in the directory tree.) 

You may have noticed that I typed `cd unixexamples`, rather than `cd /Users/Adam/unixexamples`.

The first is the relative path; the second is the absolute path.

To refer to a file, you need to either be in the directory where the file is located, or you need to refer to it using a relative or absolute path name.

EXAMPLES:   
`pwd`,  
`echo "Testing 1 2 3" > test.txt`,  
`ls`,  
`cat test.txt`,    
`cd ..`,  
`cat test.txt`,  
`cat unixexamples/test.txt`

`pwd`   print working directory  
`ls`  list contents of current directory  
`ls -a`  list contents, including hidden files  
`ls -l`  list contents, including size of files  
`mkdir` creat a new directory  
`cd dname` change directory to dname    
`cd ..`  change to parent directory    
`cd ~`  change to home directory   
`mv`  move or rename a file    
`touch` create a new empty file   
`rm`   remove a file    
`rm -r` remove all lower level files     
`wc -l`  count the number of lines in a file     
`head -5`  look at the first 5 lines of a file   
`cat` print contents of a file    
`tail` look at end of file    
`cp` copy a file   
`echo` display a line of text written in the terminal   
`wget` download a file from the web  


`cat ~/book/ch02/data/movies.txt`,  
`wc -l ~/book/ch02/data/movies.txt`,   
`head -2 ~/book/ch02/data/movies.txt`,   
`echo hello world!`,   
`touch test`,   
`wget houses.csv http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/datasets/SaratogaHouses.csv`,   
`head houses.csv`


EXAMPLES:   
`ls -a book > text`,   
`cat text`,   
`sort -r text > text`,   
`cat text`, `cat`,   
`echo hello friend >> text`,   
`cat`,   
`cat >> text`

The idea behind _pipes_ is that rather than redirecting output to a file, we redirect it into another command. This is analygous to pipes `%>%` in the `dplyr` package.

Another way to say this is that output of one command is used as input to another command.

EXAMPLES:   
`cat > somenumbers.txt`,  
`cat somenumbers.txt | uniq | sort`

Here are two more useful filters:

`egrep` - print lines matching a pattern (regex)

EXAMPLE:   
`egrep e *.txt`  will print all lines in any file ending with .txt which contain the regex e.

`cut` - select portions of each line of a file

EXAMPLE:   
`cat houses.csv | cut -d ',' -f 2-4 | head `
```


```{}
Sed has many uses but we will focus on sed for substitution
__syntax__: `sed s/regex/replacement/FLAG file`   OR
`cat file |  sed s/regex/replacement/FLAG`
FLAGS can be any of the following:

* nothing  Replace only first instance of Regexp with replacement
* g Replace all the instances of Regexp with replacement
* n Could be any number, replae nth instance of regex with replacement
* i match Regex in a case insensitive manner.

EXAMPLE:   
` echo one two three, three two one, one one hundred > file`
` cat file | sed s/one/ONE/g`  


EXAMPLE:   
`echo day sunday | sed s/day/night/`

## 3. Converting one liners at the command line into a shell scipt

In lecture 27 we saw the following commands to make a file called `small_potatoes`

`wget -O potatoes.txt http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/importing_data_into_r/potatoes.txt`  
`cat potatoes.txt | cut -f 1-2 > small_potatoes`  
`head small_potatoes`  

Suppose we would like to actually make this into a script that we can reuse.

Steps:

1. type nano potatoes.sh  
2. copy and paste the above commands  
3. define a hashbang  (#!/usr/bin/env bash)
4. add permission to execute (chmod u+x potatoes.sh)
5. parameterize (./potatoes.sh 3)

```

###Steps to find top 5 producers of apricots:

1. _Download the data for apricots_. 

Solution:

lets make a new directory called `apricots`

`mkdir apricots`  
`cd apricots`

Download  the data from the URL.
Note that you may need to put the http address inside double quotes when using `wget` to download it since there is the metacharacter `?` in the URL.

`wget -O temp.zip "http://data.un.org/Handlers/DownloadHandler.ashx?DataFilter=itemCode:526&DataMartId=FAO&Format=csv&c=2,3,4,5,6,7&s=countryName:asc,elementCode:asc,year:desc"`

`rm UN*

`unzip -o temp.zip`       -o means overwrite existing file

`mv UN* file.csv` 


2. _Extract the data for individual countries into a separate file._

View unzipped file with `less`

`less file.csv`  

`grep -v + file.csv > apricotCountries.csv`   

Here -v is invert match. grep treats + as the literal character +. If you use egrep then + is treated as a metacharacter and you need to escape it (i.e. egrep -v "\+" file.csv)

3. _Then subset the country-level data to the year 2005. Based on the â???oarea harvested determine the five countries using the most land to produce apricots._

We need to clean up the data first.

Notice that some countries and regions have commas in the country name (ex Iran, Islamic Republic of). Here is a fix.

`cat apricotCountries.csv | sed "s/, / /g" > apricotCountries1.csv`

Notice we need to remove " so that we can sort numerically, and we only care about "Area Harvested".

`cat apricotCountries1.csv | sed "s/\"//g"  | grep Harvested  > apricotCountries_clean.csv` 

Note: We need to escape the " character with a forward slash

`cat apricotCountries_clean.csv | grep 2005 | sort -t ','  -n -k 6 -r | cut -d ',' -f 1,6 | sed "s/,/   /g" | head -n5`     Note: expression after sed in quotes because space is a metacharacter
