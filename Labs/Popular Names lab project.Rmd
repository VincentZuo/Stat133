Obtain a yearly total count
```{r}
BabyNames_yearly <- BabyNames %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise( total = sum(count))
```

Filter the names that I'm interested in
```{r}
BabyNames_used <- BabyNames %>% filter(name == "Bonnie" | name == "Vincent" | name == "Alex") %>% group_by(name, year) %>% summarise(sum = sum(count))
```

Find the percentage of the chosen names over all names 
```{r}
BabyNames_join <- BabyNames_used %>% left_join(BabyNames_yearly, by = c("year" = "year"))

BabyNames_plot <- BabyNames_join %>% mutate(popularity = sum/total)
```

Plot the graph
```{r}    
BabyNames_plot %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = popularity, group = name)) + geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.5, aes(color = name)) + ylab("Popularity") + xlab("Year")
```
