## 1. Analyze the data 
In this part, I filter the data provided, only keeping cases with CONTROL value 1 or 2, CCSIZSET value 2, 3, 4, and 5. Then I select certain columns in entries and join them with the NPT4 to get the short names.
```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
load("ScorecardSmall.Rda")
qnames = read.csv('NPT4-names.csv')
library(ggthemes)

Variables <- ScorecardSmall %>%
  gather(key = long_name, value = NETCOST, NPT41_PUB:NPT45_PRIV)

Variables_narrow <- Variables %>%
  filter(NETCOST != "NA" & CONTROL != 3 & !(CCSIZSET %in% c(1, 6, 7, 8)))

Variables_join <- qnames %>%
  left_join(Variables_narrow) %>%
  select(ADM_RATE, CONTROL, short_name, NETCOST)

Variables_exp <- Variables_join %>%
  filter(short_name != "Q2" & short_name != "Q4")

Variables_mutate <- Variables_exp %>%
  mutate(CONTROL = ifelse(CONTROL == 1, "Public", "Private"))

Variables_mutate$ADM_RATE = Variables_mutate$ADM_RATE * 100
Variables_mutate$NETCOST = Variables_mutate$NETCOST/1000
```


## 2. Plot the graph
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
ggplot(Variables_mutate, aes(x = ADM_RATE, y = NETCOST)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = "blue") +
  facet_grid(CONTROL ~ short_name) +
  stat_smooth(method=loess, color = "red") +
  theme_igray() +
  labs(title = "Score Card", x = "Admission rate, %", y = "Net cost per year, $,000") +
  theme()

```
