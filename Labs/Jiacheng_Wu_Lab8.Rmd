### Problem 1
```{r}
# for calculation adopted from the lab
vec = 1:50
i = 1

while(i < 50) {
  vec[i] <- i^2
  i <- i + 1
}

# vectorized calculation
vecV <- 1:50
vecV[1:49] <- vecV[1:49]^2

all.equal(vec, vecV)

```

### Problem 2
Write down what the vector x will contain after each line of R code, if they are executed sequentially.
The values are written in the initialization form of the vector, and are checked by the `identical()` function
```{r}
# part 1
x <- seq(from = 0, to = 8, by = 2)
x_contain <- c(0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
identical(x, x_contain, num.eq = TRUE)

# part 2
x[x < 4] <- NA
x_contain <-c(NA, NA, 4, 6, 8)
# The first two outputs are NA because in R NA == NA will output NA
identical(x, x_contain, num.eq = TRUE, single.NA = TRUE )

# part 3
x[] <- 0
x_contain <-c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
identical(x, x_contain, num.eq = TRUE)

# part 4
x <- 0
x_contain <- 0
identical(x, x_contain, num.eq = TRUE)

```

### Problem 3
The lapply function in R operates on a vector and returns a list.

### Problem 4
```{r}
# Initialization process
set.seed(1337)
m <- matrix(runif(15000, -3, 3), ncol = 3)

# use for loop to calculate the squared sum
m.ssq.loop <- vector(, 0)
for (i in 1:5000) {
  a_sq = m[i, 1]^2
  b_sq = m[i, 2]^2
  c_sq = m[i, 3]^2
  m.ssq.loop <- c(m.ssq.loop, a_sq+b_sq+c_sq)
}

# use apply function 
m.ssq.apply <- apply(m, 1, function(x) x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + x[3]^2)

# sanity
identical(m.ssq.loop, m.ssq.apply, num.eq = TRUE)
```

### Problem 5
```{r}
# Initialization from the lab
Year <- c(2000, 2001)
Algeria <- c(7 ,9)
Brazil <- c(12, NA)
Columbia <- c(16, 18)

table1 <- data.frame(Year, Algeria, Brazil, Columbia)

# part a
table2 <- table1 %>%
  gather(Country, Value, Algeria, Brazil, Columbia) %>%
  select(Country, Year, Value) %>%
  arrange(Country)
table2

# part b
## calculate the averages
table3 <- table2 %>%
  spread(Country, Value)
table3$Average <- rowMeans(table3[, -1], na.rm = TRUE)
table3
```

### Problem 6

#### (a). glyphs in the graph
There are points and lines in this graph.
#### (b). aesthetics of each glyph
The points have colors, x position and y position. The lines have colors and positions are determined by points.
#### (c). variables are being mapped to each aesthetic
Educ is mapped to x position of the point, Wage is mapped to y position. Sex is mapped to color of both the points and the lines.
#### (d). Are the variables qualitative or quantitative
Wage and Educ are quantitative. Sex is qualitative.
#### (e). What are the guides on this graph?
There are title, legends, x axies label and y axies label.
#### (f). reconstruct the graphics
```{r}
data <- CPS85 %>%
  select(wage, educ, sex) %>%
  group_by(sex)
ggplot(data, aes(x = educ, y = wage, col = sex)) +geom_point() +ylim(0, 15) + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + ggtitle("Wage vs. Education in CPS85")
```

### Problem 7
```{r}
# part a
SplitChars <- function(string) {
  list <- unlist(strsplit(string, ""))
  return (list)
}

my.string <- "ggplot2 is a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R"
res <- SplitChars(my.string)
res

# part b
asRr <- c("a", "s", "R", "r")
count <- 0
for (i in 1:length(res)) {
  if (res[i] %in% asRr) {
    count <- count + 1
  }
}
count

# part c
Reverse <- function(vector) {
  mid <- ceiling(length(vector) /2)
  last <- length(vector)+1
  for (i in 1:mid) {
    tmp <- vector[i]
    vector[i] <- vector[last-i]
    vector[last-i] <- tmp
  }
  return (vector)
}
my.string %>% SplitChars %>% Reverse
```
