1. Plot by dates
#################
```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
data("Birthdays", package = "mosaicData")
DailyBirths <-
  Birthdays %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(births))

ggplot(DailyBirths, aes(x= date, y = total)) + geom_point()
```
We can plot out daily births vs. date in the R Studio.

load lubridate 
```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
library(lubridate)
```

a. every week
```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
WeeklyBirths <- Birthdays %>%
  mutate(week = week(date)) %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarize(total=sum(births))
head(WeeklyBirths)
```

b. every month
```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
MonthlyBirths <- Birthdays %>%
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(total=sum(births))
head(MonthlyBirths)
```


c. Julian Day
```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
JDayBirths <- DailyBirths %>%
  mutate(Jday = yday(date)) %>%
  group_by(Jday) %>%
  summarize(total=sum(total))
head(JDayBirths)
```

```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
Weekdays <- Birthdays %>%
  group_by(wday) %>%
  summarize(total=sum(births))
Weekdays
```

```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
MyTwoYears <-
  Birthdays %>%
  filter(year(date) == 1980 | year(date) == 1981) %>%
  group_by(date, wday) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(births))
head(MyTwoYears)
ggplot(MyTwoYears, aes(x= date, y=total, color=wday)) + geom_point()
```

The trend is pretty evident from the the plot, for both weekday and weekends, the peak takes place from July to October. And relatively same across other months.

```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}

```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
Holidays_filtered <- Holidays %>%
  filter(year==1980 | year==1981)

MyTwoYears2 <- MyTwoYears %>%
  left_join(Holidays_filtered, by=c("date"="date")) %>%
  select(date,holiday,total,wday)

Holidays_joined <- Holidays %>%
  left_join(MyTwoYears, by=c("date"="date")) %>%
  select(date, holiday, wday, year)
head(Holidays_joined)

MyTwoYears2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=total))+
  geom_point(aes(col=wday))+
  geom_text(aes(label=holiday, y=9300,  angle=50),colour="black")+
  geom_vline(data = Holidays_joined, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(date), col = wday))
```

```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
CombinedTable2 <- CombineTable %>%
  mutate(is_holiday=ifelse(is.na(holiday), "no", "yes"))
head(CombinedTable2)
```

```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width= 9}
ggplot(CombinedTable2, aes(x=date, y=total)) +
geom_point(aes(color=wday,size = is_holiday)) +
geom_vline(data=Holidays_filtered, aes(xintercept=as.numeric(date))) +
geom_text(data= Holidays_filtered, aes(label=holiday, y= 9200, angle=65), color = "black")
```

Hypothesis is inccorrect, we can see that holidays like President's day and columbus day still follows the pattern in 4.
