Answer of (5): I think the fifth plot with position argument is the most effective. Because it removes the shading of one one another, so one can clearly see the superior layer.    
But it does have some drawbacks, forinstance we lose infomation on the inferior layer.

Answer of (6): It is better to facet on whether it is weekend since this gives more compacted information.
