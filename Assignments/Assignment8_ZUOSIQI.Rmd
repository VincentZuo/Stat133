1. In everyday language, describe a pattern that you think will identify the information you are looking for.   
2. Translate (1) into the form of a regular expression.   
3. Filter to retain the cases that match the expression. Hint: filter() and grepl() are useful for this.   
4. Filter to retain the cases that do not match the expression.   
5. Examine the results of (2) and (3) to identify shortcomings in your patterns.   
6. Improve or extend the pattern to deal with the mistaken cases.   
6. Repeat until satisfied.   
Put extraction parentheses around the parts of the regular expression that contain the info you want.   

```{r}
download.file(url="http://tiny.cc/dcf/CMS_ProvidersSimple.rds",
              destfile = "YourNameForTheFile.rds", mode = "wb")
DataTable <- readRDS("YourNameForTheFile.rds")
Addresses <- read.file("http://tiny.cc/dcf/street-addresses.csv")
```

Use the provided pattern to test for potential extractions

```{r}
head(Addresses)
pattern <- "(ST|RD|ROAD)" # It constructs string containing "ST","RD" or "ROAD".
LeftOvers <-
  Addresses %>% 
  filter( ! grepl(pattern, address), #Select every address without the pattern above,
          ! grepl(" APT|UNIT [[:digit:]]+$", address)) # also address that does not contain APT or unit number
head(LeftOvers)
```

Now apply the same trick on datatable:

```{r}
nrow(DataTable)
pattern <- "(ST|RD|ROAD)( |\\.|$)"
LeftOvers <-
  DataTable %>% 
  filter( ! grepl(pattern, address))

nrow(LeftOvers)

sampled <- LeftOvers %>%
  sample_n(size = 20)
sampled
```

After some test reading above i found AVE, PKWY, BLVD , WAY

```{r}
pattern <- "(AVENUE|AVE|PKWY|BLVD|WAY)( |\\.|$)"
LeftOvers <-
  LeftOvers %>% 
  filter( ! grepl(pattern, address))

nrow(LeftOvers)

sampled <- LeftOvers %>%
  sample_n(size = 20)
sampled
```

After some test reading above i found PARK, HWY, DR, DRIVE
```{r}
pattern <- "(PARK|HWY|DR|DRIVE)( |\\.|$)"
LeftOvers <-
  LeftOvers %>% 
  filter( ! grepl(pattern, address))

nrow(LeftOvers)

sampled <- LeftOvers %>%
  sample_n(size = 20)
sampled
```

After some test reading above i found PL, NE, VLG, STE, STREET, LN, SQ
```{r}
pattern <- "(PL|NE|VLG|STE|STREET|LN|SQ)( |\\.|$)"
LeftOvers <-
  LeftOvers %>% 
  filter( ! grepl(pattern, address))

nrow(LeftOvers)

sampled <- LeftOvers %>%
  sample_n(size = 20)
sampled
```


After some test reading above i found PLAZA, NALL, ROUTE
```{r}
pattern <- "(PLAZA|HALL|MALL|ROUTE)( |\\.|$)"
LeftOvers <-
  LeftOvers %>% 
  filter( ! grepl(pattern, address))

nrow(LeftOvers)

sampled <- LeftOvers %>%
  sample_n(size = 20)
sampled
```

##Results

Now I reduced the size of unfiltered from 909605 to 57548, which is sufficient reduction
```{r}
pattern = "(ST|RD|ROAD|AVENUE|AVE|PKWY|BLVD|WAY|PARK|HWY|DR|DRIVE|PL|NE|VLG|STE|STREET|PLAZA|HALL|MALL|ROUTE)( |\\.|$)"
res <-
  DataTable %>% 
  extractMatches(pattern, address) %>%
  filter(!is.na(match1))
```

Here are most common ending for addresses.
```{r}
res %>%
  group_by(match1) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(10)
```
